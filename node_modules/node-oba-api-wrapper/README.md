# node-oba-api-wrapper

This is a wrapper for [the API made by Rijk van Zanten.](https://github.com/rijkvanzanten/node-oba-api);

## Usage
Usage is the same as the API it was built upon.

Install package and dependencies
```shell
npm i maanlamp/node-oba-api-wrapper
```

Require it in your code
```js
const OBAWrapper = require("node-oba-api-wrapper");

const client = new OBAWrapper({
	//public?: ...
});

client.get("endpoint", options).then...
```

### OBAWrapper.get(endpoint, options)
Returns a promise that will resolve into an array of book objects picked from the original response.

- endpoint: `string`

[Find possible endpoints here.](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/functional-programming/blob/master/README.md)

- options: `object`

**Custom properties:**
- `count: x (number)`: Amount of results you want.
- `log: true|false (boolean)`: Whether or not to log some things you might want to see.
- `filter (item: resultObject): function`: A function that will be applied to every item in order to check if the item is desirable. Will run before calculating intermediate result count so you will get exactly `count` items or the server might crash, burn or just reject your request. It's a 50/50 thing ü§∑‚Äç.
